1. Software environment preparation\
##1.1 Python 3.6\
##1.2 Install OpenAI gym\
2.Code link:\
	
3.Policy Iteration and value iteration code\
	3.1 Code name:mdp.py\
	3.2 Execute the mdp.py and pick the result from "Frozen Lake Large" and Taxi\
	3.3 Description: it will generate the number of iteration and running time for value iteration and policy iteration for one state \for each problem\
	3.4 For Taxi V2 comparision, run the Taxi-v2 part multiple time for different start states and average the results.\
4. Q-learning implementation\
	4.1 Frozen Lake\
		4.1.1 Code Name: q_learning_frozen_lake.py\
		4.1.2 Chose the number of iteration and then Execute the code\
	4.2 Taxi-v2\
		4.2.1 Code Name: Q_learning_sarsmax.py\
		4.2.2 Chose the number of iteration and then Execute the code\
	4.3 Discount factor analysis\
		Chose the discount factor gamma that you want to test from 4.1 and 4.2, and then run the codes\
	4.4 learning rate analysis\
		Chose the learning rate value that you want to test from 4.2 and 4.2, and then run the codes\
